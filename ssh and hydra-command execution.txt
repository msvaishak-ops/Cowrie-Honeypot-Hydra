💣 Attack Execution (Hydra SSH from Kali)
🛠️ Set IP on Kali (after every reboot)
sudo ip addr flush dev eth0
sudo ip addr add 192.168.56.20/24 dev eth0
sudo ip link set eth0 up

Test ping:

ping 192.168.56.10

ssh connection from kali(attack machine) to ubuntu(cowrie):
ssh -p 2222 root@192.168.56.10 
If it asks: root@192.168.56.10's password: → that’s Cowrie.

Type any random password (e.g. 1234) then Ctrl+C to quit.

This confirms Kali can reach the honeypot.

💣Run Hydra attack from Kali

Now run your brute-force:

hydra -t 4 -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.56.10 -s 2222 ssh


Hydra will start trying lots of passwords against Cowrie’s SSH.

You do not need to log in successfully first – Hydra is doing the guessing.

📊Watch Cowrie logs on Ubuntu while Hydra runs

Back on Ubuntu (in another terminal or the same as cowrie user):

sudo su - cowrie
cd ~/cowrie/var/log/cowrie
tail -f cowrie.log


You’ll see lines like:

login attempt [root/123456]
login attempt [root/password]
...


That’s your Hydra attack being recorded 🎯
